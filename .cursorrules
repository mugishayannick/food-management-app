Welcome to A2SV Project Interview
Hello Candidate, and welcome.
This technical interview is designed to evaluate how you approach real-world engineering challenges. We’re not only interested in what you know, but in how you build, how you structure your code, reason through problems, and make implementation decisions.
We’re looking for engineers who write clean, scalable, and well-documented code that reflects best practices and attention to detail.
Show us your best work. Communicate your thought process, explain your trade-offs, and deliver code you’d confidently deploy in a real environment.
Good luck. We are excited to see what you can build.

Overview
Your challenge is to implement a functional and user-friendly web page using Next.js and TypeScript, based on a provided Figma design. You will connect this frontend to a mock API for data.
This task evaluates your ability to translate design into code, build reusable components, manage application state, and interact with a REST API, while following best practices in code structure and maintainability.
Duration
Deadline: The candidate is expected to submit the project latest by Wednesday, November 12, 2025, by 12:00 PM CAT(UTC+2)  
No submissions or commits should be made after the timer ends. Pushing changes after the timer ends will result in disqualification.

Goal
The objective of this web assessment is to create a functional and user-friendly website that allows users to efficiently manage food items. The system should enable users to:
Search for food items quickly and accurately.
Add, edit, and remove food items with ease.
View a well-organized list of available food items.
The implementation should ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining data integrity and system responsiveness.
Steps to Follow
Implementation
Aim to implement as much of the Figma design as possible.
Use reusable components and clean code practices.
Adhere to accessibility and semantic HTML standards.
Follow the Candidate Submission Guidelines for UI and form elements (outlined below).
Version Control
Create a new public repository on GitHub for your submission.
Commit your progress regularly with meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Added header component").
Ensure all your code is pushed to the repository before the timer ends.
Submission
Deploy your project to a live environment (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages).
Double-check that your repository is public and accessible.
Submit your GitHub repository link and project URL through the provided Google Form.
Disqualification Criteria
Pushing changes to the repository after the timer ends.
Submitting incomplete or inaccessible repositories.

API endpoints for Food Wagen
Get Featured Foods (Restaurants): https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food
Some foods returned by the API may not include restaurant information. Candidates should handle and display such cases gracefully in the UI.

Create Food: https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food

- Created foods are expected to be associated with restaurants (name, logo, status). Candidates should ensure this association when submitting new food items.
  Update Food: https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food/[id]

Delete Food: https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food/[id]
Filter foods: https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food?name=[searchParam]

Candidate Submission Guidelines
General Structure
Component Naming
Use clear and descriptive names for components, classes, and IDs.
Ensure proper folder structure for components (e.g., /components, /pages, /styles).
CSS Class Rules
Allowed Class Naming:
Vanilla CSS: All classes must start with .food- (e.g., .food-card, .food-status).
Tailwind: Custom classes must include the food- prefix (e.g., food-btn, food-item).
Test ID Convention
All test IDs must start with food-
Example: data-test-id="food-delete-btn"
Mandatory Test Coverage
Candidates must write tests for at least 3 critical scenarios, covering:
Component Rendering
Verify that the component renders correctly with expected props (e.g., displays food name, price, or rating).
User Interaction
Test one interactive element (choose either):
Button click (e.g., delete, edit, or submit actions).
Form input and submission
API Mocking
Test one API-related behavior (choose either):
Successful data fetch and display (e.g., mock GET request).
Error handling (e.g., failed API request shows error message).
.API calls must be mocked (no real network requests in tests)
Form Input Naming
Use descriptive attributes for input elements to make them easily identifiable:
Food Name: input[name="food_name"]
Food Rating: input[name="food_rating"] (type should be number).
Food Image URL: input[name="food_image"].
Restaurant Name: input[name="restaurant_name"].
Restaurant Logo URL: input[name="restaurant_logo"].
Restaurant Status: input[name="restaurant_status"] (values should be “Open Now” or “Closed”).
Dropdown Options
Only allowed values:
"Open Now"
"Closed"
Default: First option selected
Validation Rules
Show error messages when:
Required field is empty
Rating is outside 1-5 range
Image URL is invalid
Error element IDs must follow:
id="restaurant_name-error"
id="restaurant_rating-error"
id="restaurant_image-error"
Form must reset after successful submission

Buttons
Use descriptive and clear labels for all buttons (e.g., "Add Food", "Subscribe").
Avoid vague labels like "Click Me" or "Submit".
Loading States (Required)
When:
During API calls (add/edit/delete actions)
During form submissions
Visual Indicators:
Show spinner icon + disabled state
Change button text to:
"Adding Food..." / "Updating Food..."
Behavior:
Disable interaction until operation completes
Revert to original state afterward

Input Fields
Placeholder Text
Must include the "food" term where relevant.
Examples:

“Enter food name”

“Select food category”

“Food price ($)”

Prohibited: Generic placeholders like “Enter text” or “Choose option”
Label Requirements
Accessibility:
All inputs must have associated label elements
Use aria-describedby for error messages
CSS Class/ID Naming
Required prefix: .food- or #food-
.food-input
#food-search
Cards and Lists
For any card (e.g., a food card), ensure the following structure:
Name: .food-name
Price: .food-price
Rating: .food-rating
Restaurant Name: .restaurant-name
Restaurant Status: .restaurant-status (e.g., “Open Now” or “Closed”)
Restaurant Logo: .restaurant-logo
Use semantic HTML elements like <div>, <section>, and <article> as needed.
Entry Animation (Required)
Type: Slide-up
Duration: 300ms
Trigger: On initial load/data fetch
Hover Animation (Required)
Type: any hover animation
Transition: 150ms ease-out
Requirement: Must not affect card dimensions

Validation and Error Handling
Ensure all required fields are validated and display clear error messages for invalid inputs or actions.
Assign the following IDs for error message elements based on the input names to keep the structure consistent:
Food Name: food-name-error
Food Rating: food-rating-error
Food Image URL: food-image-error
Restaurant Name: restaurant-name-error
Restaurant Logo URL: restaurant-logo-error
Restaurant Status: restaurant-status-error

Use the following descriptive and user-friendly error messages:
“Food Name is required” for food-name-error.
“Food Rating must be a number” for food-rating-error.
“Food Image URL is required” for food-image-error.
“Restaurant Name is required” for restaurant-name-error.
“Restaurant Logo URL is required” for restaurant-logo-error.
“Restaurant Status must be ‘Open Now’ or ‘Closed’” for restaurant-status-error.
Empty States
Implement empty states with meaningful messages (e.g., "No items available" in a <div> with .empty-state-message).
Mandatory Elements
Heading: Must include descriptive header
Description: Actionable guidance (25-50 characters)
Footer
Include navigation links and company information in the footer.
Modal
Trigger modals with a button labeled "Add Food", “Edit Food” and “Delete Food”.
Ensure all modal fields have descriptive names and IDs (e.g., input[name="food_name"]).
Include "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.
All modals must:
Have 100% width on mobile
Centered in desktop view
